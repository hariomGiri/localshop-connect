# Community MarketLink - Technical Questions and Answers

## Architecture and Design

### Q1: Why did you choose React with TypeScript for the frontend?
**A:** React with TypeScript was chosen for several reasons:
1. **Component Reusability**: React's component-based architecture allows for reusable UI elements.
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript adds static typing, which helps catch errors during development.
3. **Developer Experience**: The combination provides excellent tooling and IDE support.
4. **Performance**: React's virtual DOM efficiently updates only what needs to change.
5. **Community Support**: Both React and TypeScript have large communities and extensive documentation.

### Q2: Explain the architecture of your application.
**A:** The application follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: Single-page application built with React, communicating with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express providing API endpoints and business logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence, using Mongoose for object modeling.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state management on the frontend.

### Q3: How does your application handle state management?
**A:** The application uses React Context API for state management:
- **CartContext**: Manages the shopping cart state across the application.
- **LocationContext**: Handles user location data for shop proximity features.
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state.

This approach was chosen over Redux for its simplicity and direct integration with React, which is sufficient for our application's complexity level.

## Authentication and Security

### Q4: How is user authentication implemented?
**A:** Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
1. User logs in with credentials (email/password).
2. Server validates credentials and generates a JWT token.
3. Token is stored in localStorage on the client.
4. Token is sent with each API request in the Authorization header.
5. Server validates the token for protected routes.
6. Different user roles (customer, shopkeeper, admin) have different access permissions.

### Q5: How do you handle security concerns in your application?
**A:** Security measures include:
1. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
2. **JWT Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication.
3. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all user inputs.
4. **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS settings to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for different user roles.
6. **Protected Routes**: Frontend and backend routes are protected based on user roles.
7. **XSS Protection**: React's built-in protection against XSS attacks.

## Database and Data Management

### Q6: Why did you choose MongoDB for this application?
**A:** MongoDB was selected for several reasons:
1. **Flexible Schema**: Allows for easy adaptation as the application evolves.
2. **JSON-Like Documents**: Natural fit for JavaScript/Node.js applications.
3. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities for future growth.
4. **Geospatial Queries**: Built-in support for location-based queries (important for our shop proximity feature).
5. **Performance**: Good read/write performance for our use case.

### Q7: Explain your database schema design.
**A:** The database has four main collections:
1. **Users**: Stores user information, authentication details, and role.
2. **Shops**: Contains shop details, location, approval status, and owner reference.
3. **Products**: Stores product information, pricing, stock, and shop reference.
4. **Orders**: Manages order details, items, payment status, and delivery information.

The schema uses references between collections (e.g., products reference their shop) to maintain relationships while leveraging MongoDB's document model.

## Frontend Implementation

### Q8: How did you implement the shopping cart functionality?
**A:** The shopping cart is implemented using:
1. **CartContext**: A React context that provides cart state and methods.
2. **useReducer**: For predictable state updates with actions like ADD_ITEM, REMOVE_ITEM, etc.
3. **localStorage**: For persistence between sessions.
4. **Cart Operations**: Functions for adding, removing, updating quantities, and clearing the cart.
5. **Multi-Shop Support**: The cart can contain items from different shops.

### Q9: How does the application handle responsive design?
**A:** Responsive design is achieved through:
1. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with built-in responsive classes.
2. **Flexible Layouts**: Grid and Flexbox for adaptable layouts.
3. **Responsive Components**: UI components that adapt to different screen sizes.
4. **Media Queries**: For specific adjustments at different breakpoints.
